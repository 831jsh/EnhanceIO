How to create persistent cache
==============================


Clean operation of a writeback cache can be trigerred through eio_cli or 
alternatively it can also be trigerred by "do_clean" sysctl. The value set 
can be any of
0 : stop the ongoing clean operation
1 : starts the clean operation (eio_cli internally uses this for clean command) 
2 : get the status of clean operation
4 : start the clean and keep it clean. 



Autoclean thresholds
----------------
a) Dirty high threshold (%) : The upper limit percentage of dirty blocks in
   an entire cache that will trigger a clean-up.
b) Dirty low threshold (%) : The lower limit percentage of dirty blocks in
   an entire cache that will stop the clean-up process.
c) Dirty set high threshold (%) : The upper limit percentage of dirty blocks
   in a set that will trigger a clean-up.
d) Dirty set low threshold (%) : The lower limit percentage of dirty blocks
   in a set that will stop the clean-up process.
e) Automatic clean-up threshold : An automatic clean-up of the cache will
   occur only if the number of outstanding I/O requests from the HDD is
   below the threshold.
f) Time based clean-up interval (minutes) : This option allows you to specify
   an interval between each clean-up process.



Persistence
-----------
EnhanceIO caches are persistent by default. A udev rule file named
94-enhanceio-<cache_name>.rules is created, removed by create, delete
sub-commands in eio_cli.
